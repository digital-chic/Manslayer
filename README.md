# Manslayer
Manslayer is a CYOA-style erotic game built around the themes of forced feminization and corruption using Twine. It deals with a main character being slowly transformed into a woman, and being tempted by evil forces to serve their will.

It is being developed by me, digitalchic, AKA Aina. It can be played online at https://digital-chic.github.io/Manslayer/
